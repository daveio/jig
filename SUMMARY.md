# Template System Reorganization

_[imagine a fox juggling template files, with shared components glowing brightly in the center]_

## Changes Made

We've reorganized the template system to use shared components:

1. **Created Shared Component Directory**:

   - `templates/shared/gitignore/` for common gitignore patterns
   - `templates/shared/github/workflows/` for shared GitHub workflow templates

2. **Extracted Common Patterns**:

   - Common gitignore patterns (IDE files, logs, env vars) into `common.gitignore`
   - Language-specific gitignore patterns into dedicated files
   - Base GitHub workflow structure into `base.yml.tera`
   - Language-specific workflow jobs into dedicated files

3. **Created Placeholder System**:

   - Simple text files that reference shared components
   - No template language in filenames
   - Logic extracted to the files themselves

4. **Updated Documentation**:
   - README.md: Added section on the template sharing system
   - LEARNING.md: Updated to explain the new structure, in \_why's style
   - CLAUDE.md: Detailed explanation for AI assistants
   - SPEC-UPDATES.md: Implementation plan for the code changes

## Implementation Completed! ðŸŽ‰

The code has been fully updated to support the new template system:

1. **New Component Module**:

   - Created `src/template/component.rs` to handle shared components
   - Added placeholder file detection
   - Implemented processors for gitignore and workflows components

2. **Updated Template Module**:

   - Modified `src/template/mod.rs` to work with the new component system
   - Added support for detecting and processing placeholder files
   - Updated template generation to handle both standard templates and shared components

3. **Added Tests**:

   - Created `src/template/tests.rs` with tests for the component system
   - Verified functionality of gitignore and workflow placeholders

4. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Updated SPEC-UPDATES.md with implementation details
   - Ensured all documentation reflects the new system

These changes have maintained backward compatibility while enabling the new shared component system, making templates more maintainable and reducing duplication. The foxes are now sharing their templates with glee!
